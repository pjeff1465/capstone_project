Meal-Plan Web Based App
## 1.0 Team Members:
Ryan Jepson, Piper Jeffries, Kelsey Bird, Evan Stamm

## 2.0 Problem Statement
Our project will solve the problem of not knowing what you are going to eat! Our app will give users an interface that is simple to use and understand to help them map out a meal plan for specific nutrition goals. It will allow users to create a grocery list for meals they have saved to their profile. Users will also be able to access a cookbook to save their recipes.

## 3.0 Proposed Solution
**3.1** - This application will provide meals and recipes where the user can provide multiple forms of input, such as the giving ingredients or filtering by food group

**3.2** - Key Features: 
- Select based on all meal times
    - Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert, appetizer, etc.
- Drop-down Filter
- Type of food, meal price, amount of people, macros of nutrition, number of ingredients, time of day, etc.
- Scale recipe and provide appropriate ingredient amounts based on number of people or total calories.
3.3 Stretch Goals:
- Allow users to sign up for an account to access the following features: 
    - Sign-up goals
    - Grocery check-list
- Get macros, find new recipes, budget meals, explore new foods, etc.

## 4.0 Expected Outcome
**4.1** Minimum Viable Product Overview: A web based application which provides a meal plan and recipes for the user based on user needs.

**4.2** MVP Components:
- Users are able to filter search options for preferred food types per food group (i.e meat: chicken, beef, vegetables: beans, carrots, etc.)
- Users are able to filter for dietary needs (i.e, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free)
- Users are able to view photo and text descriptions of recipes and save favorites to profile (if we set up database)
